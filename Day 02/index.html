    <h2>3 Keys to Accelerated Learning</h2>
    <h3>Three techniques you can use to learn faster and more effectively.</h3>
    <p>One key to <em>accelerated learning</em> is <strong>active recall</strong>. Actively making the effort to produce the information drastically increases retention.<br>Another key is <strong>spaced repetition</strong>. Recalling the information in increasingly spaced-out intervals of time.<br>One more key to accelerated learning is to keep a <strong>beginner's mind</strong>. This means going into new subjects with an open mind, without old misconceptions.</p>
